## Prompt
```text
Predict the next 14 day trend for Ethereum.
Output daily highs and lows in USD and output the results in an ASCII table code box.
Output your response in a separate code box using markdown format.
```

## Response
```text
The Ethereum price data in the provided CSV file includes three columns: "Date(UTC)", "UnixTimeStamp", and "Value". To predict the next 14-day trend for Ethereum, including daily highs and lows, I'll apply a time series forecasting model. Since the "Value" column likely represents the closing price, I will use this for forecasting. I will start by analyzing the data, then fit an appropriate forecasting model, and finally, predict the daily highs and lows for the next 14 days.

Let's proceed with the analysis and modeling. ​​

Error analyzing
It appears that the ARIMA model from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model is deprecated. I will use the updated ARIMA model from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model. Let's proceed with this updated approach for the Ethereum price forecast. ​​

Error analyzing
There was an issue with unpacking the forecast values. I'll correct this and proceed with generating the forecasted highs and lows for Ethereum for the next 14 days. Let's adjust the code accordingly. ​​

The forecast for the next 14 days of Ethereum's price in terms of daily high and low values (in USD) is ready. I'll now present this forecast data in an ASCII table format. ​
